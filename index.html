              Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, known as the Missile Man of India, was an aerospace scientist who played a critical role in India's civilian space and missile programs. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become a key figure in developing India’s missile technology and eventually served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.

              Throughout his career, Dr. Kalam was known for his visionary leadership and commitment to inspiring the youth of India. He was instrumental in developing the SLV-III, which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite, marking a significant milestone in India’s space program. His work earned him the title “Missile Man,” and his tenure as President was marked by a deep connection with citizens, especially young students.
